## How to Play

Welcome to Hotkey Incremental! This is an idle incremental game where you produce currency for letters A through Z. Each letter produces currency automatically, and you can upgrade them to increase production rates.

## Game Mechanics

### Production Formula
Your production rate is calculated as:
**Production = (Base Production × Multiplier)^Exponent**

Each letter's production combines:
- Its own upgrades (Base Production, Multiplier, Exponent)
- The previous letter's "Next Letter" upgrades (if unlocked)

### Letter Unlocking
- Letters unlock automatically when the previous letter reaches 10 billion times its current amount
- Example: If letter A has 1,000, then B unlocks when A reaches 10,000,000,000,000
- Letters unlock in order: A → B → C → ... → Z
- Only unlocked letters can produce currency

## Upgrade Types

Each letter has 6 different upgrades:

### Current Letter Upgrades

1. **Base Production**
   - Effect: Adds +1 to base production per level
   - Cost: Starts at 25, increases with complex scaling
   - Tip: Foundation of your production - always valuable!

2. **Multiplier**
   - Effect: Adds +0.5 to multiplier per level
   - Cost: Starts at 500, increases with complex scaling
   - Tip: Multiplies your base production before the exponent

3. **Power Multiplier (Exponent)**
   - Effect: Adds +0.1 to exponent per level
   - Cost: Starts at 10,000, increases with complex scaling
   - Tip: Most powerful upgrade - exponentially increases production!

### Next Letter Upgrades

These upgrades affect the NEXT letter's production (once unlocked):

4. **Next Letter Base Production**
   - Effect: Adds +1 to next letter's base production per level
   - Cost: Starts at 10 billion, doubles per level
   - Tip: Invest in these to boost new letters when they unlock!

5. **Next Letter Multiplier**
   - Effect: Adds +0.5 to next letter's multiplier per level
   - Cost: Starts at 10 trillion, multiplies by 5 per level
   - Tip: Helps new letters get a strong start

6. **Next Letter Power Multiplier**
   - Effect: Adds +0.1 to next letter's exponent per level
   - Cost: Starts at 10 quadrillion, multiplies by 10 per level
   - Tip: Most expensive but gives huge boosts to new letters

## Tips & Strategies

### Early Game (Letters A-E)
- Focus on Base Production and Multiplier upgrades
- Power Multiplier is expensive early but becomes crucial later
- Don't worry about Next Letter upgrades yet

### Mid Game (Letters F-P)
- Start investing in Next Letter upgrades to prepare for new letters
- Balance current letter upgrades with next letter investments
- Power Multiplier becomes more valuable as production scales

### Late Game (Letters Q-Z)
- Next Letter upgrades are essential for smooth progression
- Power Multiplier has the biggest impact at high levels
- Use hotkeys to efficiently manage multiple letters

### General Tips
- **Exponent is King**: The exponent upgrade has exponential returns - prioritize it when affordable
- **Plan Ahead**: Invest in Next Letter upgrades before unlocking new letters
- **Use Hotkeys**: Press A-Z to quickly upgrade letters without switching views
- **Balance is Key**: Don't ignore any upgrade type - they all work together
- **Production Compounds**: Higher production = more currency = more upgrades = even higher production

### Upgrade Cost Scaling
- Upgrade costs increase at different rates based on level thresholds
- Costs scale more aggressively at higher levels
- Base Production has the gentlest scaling
- Power Multiplier has the most aggressive scaling

## Understanding Production

### Why Exponent Matters
If you have:
- Base: 10
- Multiplier: 5
- Exponent: 2

Production = (10 × 5)^2 = 50^2 = 2,500

If you increase exponent to 2.1:
Production = (10 × 5)^2.1 = 50^2.1 ≈ 2,800

Small exponent increases create huge production gains!

### Synergy Between Upgrades
All upgrades multiply together:
- Base Production × Multiplier = Combined Base
- Then raise to the power of Exponent
- Previous letter's Next Letter upgrades add to all three values

This means upgrading everything together creates exponential growth!

## Common Questions

**Q: Why isn't my letter producing currency?**
A: Only unlocked letters produce. Check if the letter is unlocked in the letter selector.

**Q: When should I focus on Next Letter upgrades?**
A: Start investing when you're close to unlocking the next letter, or when current letter upgrades become expensive.

**Q: What's the best upgrade order?**
A: The default order prioritizes Next Letter upgrades first, then Exponent, then Multiplier, then Base Production. This maximizes long-term growth.

**Q: Can I unlock letters out of order?**
A: No, letters unlock sequentially A→B→C→...→Z. You must unlock in order.

**Q: Do hotkeys work for locked letters?**
A: No, hotkeys only work for unlocked letters. Locked letters have no currency to spend.

## Advanced Strategies

### The Compound Effect
Since production compounds (more production = more upgrades = more production), early investments pay off exponentially over time.

### The Exponent Rush
Once you can afford Power Multiplier upgrades, they often provide the best return on investment due to exponential scaling.

### Next Letter Preparation
Investing in Next Letter upgrades before unlocking gives new letters a massive head start, making progression smoother.

### Hotkey Efficiency
Use hotkeys to quickly upgrade all your letters without manually switching between them. This saves time and keeps all letters progressing.

Good luck and have fun reaching Z!
